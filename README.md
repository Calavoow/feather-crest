Feather Crest
=============
Feather Crest is a Scala library for accessing the EVE Online CREST API.
It will target the JVM language, thus also work for Scala, Java, Clojure and other JVM languages.
The main supported languages, however, will be Scala and Java.

## Interface
With Feather Crest you will be able to use the CREST API as if it were a local asynchronous data object.
Requests to the API are sent asynchronously using Futures,
which allow the user to easily manage a parallel environment.

The CREST is modelled using small data classes, into which API results are stored.
When these classes are instanced, the data is checked against the model typing.
This strong typing has a lot of benefits over a dynamic typing implementation,
but let us not hold this discussion here.

A unique feature of the CREST are the links to other resource, using internal links.
This is modeled using the `CrestLink` class which mainly provides a `follow` method to follow these links.
When the `follow` method is called, the linked model is instanced.
This in turn allows further traversal through the CREST API,
which is closely related to the intended interaction method of CREST.
